Hi! My name is Hew Siang Ling <img src="hornet.gif" width="75"/>

I'm a Graphics And Multimedia Software Student in UTM 
-
A person who enjoys games, music, philosophy, art, code, and more. I am interested in works born from the fusion of art or philosophy with games and technology. I learn and practice coding, focusing on building small projects, prototypes, and interactive experiences, which helps me understand technical architecture and design thinking. I value the process of iteration, problem-solving, and continuous learning. I am dedicated to developing a profound and highly personal work of my own.

* 💻  I'm currently learning **coding**
* 🎮  I'm currently working on my own **Indie Game**
